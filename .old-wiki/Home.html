<h3> Styling your wiki </h3>
<p>You may style this page as you like or you can simply leave the style as it is. You can easily keep the styling and edit the content of these default wiki pages with your project information and completely fulfill the requirement to document your project.</p>
<p>While you may not win Best Wiki with this styling, your team is still eligible for all other awards. This default wiki meets the requirements, it improves navigability and ease of use for visitors, and you should not feel it is necessary to style beyond what has been provided.</p>

<h3> Uploading pictures and files </h3>
<p> You must upload any pictures and files to the iGEM 2018 server. Remember to keep all your pictures and files within your team's namespace or at least include your team's name in the file name. </p>


<p>When you upload, set the "Destination Filename" to <b> T--YourOfficialTeamName--NameOfFile.jpg</b>. (If you don't do this, someone else might upload a different file with the same "Destination Filename", and your file would be erased!)</p>

<h3>Tips</h3>
<p>This wiki will be your team’s first interaction with the rest of the world, so here are a few tips to help you get started: </p>
<ul>
<li>State your accomplishments! Tell people what you have achieved from the start. </li>
<li>Be clear about what you are doing and how you plan to do this.</li>
<li>You have a global audience! Consider the different backgrounds that your users come from.</li>
<li>Make sure information is easy to find; nothing should be more than 3 clicks away.  </li>
<li>Avoid using very small fonts and low contrast colors; information should be easy to read.  </li>
<li>Start documenting your project as early as possible; don’t leave anything to the last minute before the Wiki Freeze. For a complete list of deadlines visit the <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Calendar">iGEM 2018 calendar</a> </li>
<li>Have lots of fun! </li>
</ul>

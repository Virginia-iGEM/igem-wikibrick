# Dev Notes

6/13/2018 For whatever reason, uploading a page with the name 'global' to the iGEM wiki means one cannot retrieve its raw data; I.E. http://2018.igem.org/Template:Virginia/css/global?action=raw&ctype=text/css yields nothing while http://2018.igem.org/Template:Virginia/css/styles?action=raw&ctype=text/css works.

6/14/2018 Idea for a theme: Faulhaber, based on a medical firm I visited in Germany. Single, judicious highlight color with various neutrals. Wireframe drawings extend off the background and onto active elements. Sort of like a physical manifestation of material design, but with some extra flair to give it character.
